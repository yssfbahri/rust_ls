# rust_ls

A simple `ls`-like utility written in Rust. Supports common listing options such as long format, sorting by size or time, showing hidden files, and displaying file authors. 
This is not meant for actual use, and has not been tested throughly (at all)

## Features

- `-a`, `--all`: Show hidden files (those starting with `.`)
- `-l`: Long listing format
- `--author`: Show the author (user) in long format
- `-t`: Sort by modification time
- `-s`: Sort by file size
- `-r`: Reverse the sorting order
- Accepts a path argument (defaults to current directory)

## Cons
- no dynamic formating
- lacks options

## Usage

```sh
cargo run -- [OPTIONS] [PATH]
```
Or build and run it 

```sh
cargo build
rust_ls -- [OPTIONS] [PATH]
```
